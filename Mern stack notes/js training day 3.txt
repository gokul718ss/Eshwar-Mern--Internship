two important folders in react:

            public folder
            src folder

three important files:

            index.html
            index.js
            index.css

note:
     as of now don't touch index files
     initially do or write a code in app.js

DOM:
    React follows (virtual dom) once here unlike html once dom  gets created
    the changes or the manipulation what we do gets completed and only that part will be rerendered

    whereas in html everytime we make change entire dom will be rerendered

Web application:

             In web application created by reactjs each and every thing is called as components

Components:

      1.functional componenet
      2.class componenet

jsx:

   writing html inside js

function App(){
return <h1>Hello World</h1>
