Let there are five components c1,c2,c3,c4,c5

props can be passed between components only by following the hierarchy
so we are using hook



the only way to achive it is passing it to hierarchy

this is not efficient to make it efficient we have an exclusive hook called useContext()

Four components
  
       app.js
       container
       users
       user       

UseContext

      Without following a hierarchy passing state ferom one component to another component in an efficient way 

Two important things
 
           create context
           use context

In the given example create context will be done in app component and that will be used in usercomponent using usecontext


Synchorising a component with external system after action monitoring or seeing the sideeffects happening in the is possible useeffect hook
